# Annas Portfolio

Single-page portfolio, built with Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lenis.

## Highlights

- Server-first data fetching in `src/app/page.tsx` with Supabase.
- Animated single-page layout powered by Framer Motion.
- Smooth scrolling and progress indicator via Lenis and a shared scroll wrapper.
- Responsive portfolio sections for hero, resume, stack, projects, and achievements.
- Remote media support for Supabase Storage, Iconify, Skill Icons, and curated external images.
- Fallback content when Supabase credentials are missing or data is unavailable.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 with the App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Framer Motion
- Lenis
- Supabase JavaScript client
- tsParticles for the animated background

## Portfolio Sections

- `Hero`: profile identity, rotating titles, summary, portrait, and contact links
- `Resume Timeline`: education and work experience
- `Technical Stack`: Data/AI, Fullstack, Tools, and GenAI groups
- `Selected Work`: featured projects with technologies and links
- `Events & Achievements`: competitions, seminars, and learning milestones

## Data Sources

The app loads portfolio content from Supabase using these tables:

- `profiles`
- `projects`
- `work_experience`
- `education`
- `events`

Technical stack badges are stored locally in [src/data/tech_stacks.json](src/data/tech_stacks.json).

If Supabase is not configured, the app falls back to local demo content from `src/lib/fallback-data.ts`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

The app safely returns fallback data when either variable is missing.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash

## Notes

- Local SQL exports and AI workflow instruction files are intentionally kept out of publish flow.
- Remote image domains are configured in `next.config.ts`.
- The current UI is optimized for a dark, editorial portfolio presentation.
